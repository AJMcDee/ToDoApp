# Tell Me What ToDo

A todo-list app built as part of my completion of The Odin Project curriculum.

## General principles

Todos and projects are objects, with todos stored within each relevant project as an array. The projects are stored in their entirety (including todos) in a separate array. All values are written to and read from this collection. 

## Known issues/future fixes

- Storage
- More padding to todo cells
- Clarify when a project is currently selected

## Created
